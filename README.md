# app-create

Project created for INNOCV (technical test), consists of a MERN SPA. This application consists of creating a (AKA CRUD).

For Back I used :

-Node Js
-Express
-MongoDB (as a database )

Endpoints to be made :

GET ALL: Get all users from database
GET: Specify and user id to get a user
CREATE: Create a new user
UPDATE: Update an existing user
REMOVE: Remove an existing user

For your application to work, you must add an .env file, indicating the port (where you want it to run on your server).
and an .env.production file for the front zone indicating the Url where you want it to connect.

I have made the Front:
-React.

I have not made the unitary tests because I did not know, and my front has not been so nice (by the lack of time), I have made this project with much illusion I would like that you comment me any thing that can help me to improve, I have many desires of continuing learning and growing in the way.

Thank you very much for this opportunity!
